/* This switches from OBJ vertex representation (xyz coordinates and

 * vertex representation (unified vertex entity, having both xyz and
 * texture coordinates).
 *
 * It is important when reading textured meshes from OBJ files, where the
 * mesh may not be homeomorphic to a disk from a geometric point of view
 * but often contain seams (vertices with multiple texture coordinates) that
 * allow to flatten it to a plane from a texturing point of view.
 *
 * What it does is to create one unified vertex entity for each unique pair
 * of xyz and uv(w) coordinates, updating the references in the polygon list
 * accordingly.
