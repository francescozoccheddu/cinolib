This folder contains a number of sample programs that illustrate the functionalities of CinoLib. 

At the moment there are just a few sample programs. Unfortunately maintaining a library alone is very time consuming, and the amount of time I can spend on CinoLib is limited.

I am currently working on a wide number of code samples that showcase the core functionalities of CinoLib. They should be available in the following weeks. All of these topics will be covered:

* Copy/paste points of view from the GL canvas for accurate visual comparisons and fast snapshot reproduction
* Customize data structures with user defined mesh/vertex/edge/polygon/polyhedron attributes
* Generate, process and visualize scalar fields
* Generate, process and visualize vector fields
* Overview of the topology editing operators implemented in CinoLib
* Evaluation of mapping distortions (angle/areas distortion popular metrics)
* Evaluation of quality metrics (polygon kernels, incircles, circumcircles)
* Computation of conformal maps for surface meshes
* Parameterization based hexahedral remeshing
* Computation of heat based geodesics for surfaces and volumes
* Surface and volumetric format converters
* Triangulation of general planar domains using the [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) wrapper
* Tetrahedralization of piece-wise linear complexes using the [Tetgen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1) wrapper
* Solve multi-labeling problems on surfaces and volumes using the [GraphCuts](http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/) wrapper
* Exploit dualization to generate general polygonal and polyhedral meshes
* Integral curve computation (and tessellation)
* Iso curve computation (and tessellation)
* Subdivision schemas for hexahedral meshes
* Uniform sphere sampling using spherical Fibonacci

and much more!
