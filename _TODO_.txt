- add matrix class (i.e. mat4<T>, with operators and contructors from quaternions, rotations, identity, diagonal, ecc)
- add ARAP deformation (https://www.igl.ethz.ch/projects/ARAP/arap_web.pdf)
- add hybrid ARAP/ASAP parameterization (http://cs.harvard.edu/~sjg/papers/arap.pdf)
- refactor interfaces for triangle and tetgen (the basic one should use serialized data, the others should refer to it)
- add a folder "file_formats", containing a description of all the non standard files used in cinolib (.hedra, scalar and vector fields, sharp features)
- add support to read/write per element labels in OFF and HEDRA
- improve canvas focus (when double click, center geometry and zoom on it, possibly adjusting clipping planes)
- make sure field_serialize is lossless in terms of numeric precision
- fix per face winding in midpoint subdivision
- fix marching tets: degenerate triangles will be generated in some cases (see comments inside cpp file)
- add ambient occlusion
- add verdict metrics for tris/quads/tets/hexa
- put edge flip and similar operators on separate files
- put cotangents (tets/tris) on a separate .h/cpp file
- add inverse and transpose operators for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices
- refactor ray/line/plane intersections and integral curve tracing 
  (check Robust Polylines Tracing for N-Symmetry Direction Field on Triangulated Surfaces)
- remove headers from serialized vector and scalar fields (itâ€™s far more general)
- update skeleton data structure (and make relative control panel)
- Gradients on hexmeshes are buggy. hint: check per face normals!
- Add cylinder and spheres list (with colors, size and so forth) in the render list used for meshes, so that there will be only on unified rendering access point
- Refactor PointInsideMeshCache, it should return ALL the elements containing the
  query point and let the application choose the best one
- Use robust geometric computations (volumes, dihedral angles ecc.) 
  (ref. => Lecture Notes on Geometric Robustness di Jonathan Richard Shewchuk)
- Add cotan laplacian  normalization
  (ref => https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~peyre/teaching/manifold/tp4.html)
- Improve on mesh rendering (shaders, VBOs (https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/VBO_-_just_examples))
- add a system of binary flags to be used by algorithms internal ti cinolib
